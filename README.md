- **Update Weights Screen**: Users can select a gym split, choose an exercise, and update the sets, reps, and weight for the exercise.

- **View Results Screen**: Users can view previous exercise logs and results for each gym split and exercise, including the latest log, sets, reps, weight, and weight increase.
